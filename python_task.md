# Task 3: Write and learn (Python, NumPy, SciPy)

**Tutor**: M.Sc. Vladimir Fadeev

**Form of reports**: Jupyter notebook based generated HTML file.

# Introduction

Yes, MatLab is very popular tool among communication systems engineers, hower it has several serious disadvantages:
- MatLab is not free;
- MATLAB language depends on MatLab/Octave that makes it less flexible than "true" programming languages;
- Most of blocks are "black boxes" (source code is not available).

This facts is good motivation to learn another popular programming language - **Python**.

Python is:
- one of central tools for Machine Learning and Deep Learning;
- used in web and communication applications;
- used as flexible way to automitize routines

and therefore it has a big and supportive community. 

Moreover, a lot of Python based solutions are open-source (and therefore free).
